<h3>The project</h3>

My project is deployed to https://young-fortress-23489.herokuapp.com/. By visiting that address, you can see that the project is running.
The contents of the project are in main.

You can do GET requests to https://young-fortress-23489.herokuapp.com/posts/ with or without an id. For example, with an id of "6037431e723995002298c51f" you will be shown Leo MÃ¤kinen's student information. Without id, you will be shown the info of all students.

You can also do a POST, DELETE, and PATCH requests. 

With POST, you can submit a new student. You need to input a name, email and university. The system will automatically submit a default status of "studies ongoing" and a registration date, which is the date at that the time of the request.

Making a DELETE request with an id deletes the student with that id.

With PATCH, it is possible to update student's information. It works like a POST request, but input of the student is needed.
